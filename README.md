# Parkinson-and-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Prediction-Model
# INTRODUCTION:
- Parkinson's disease (PD) is a widespread neurological condition that has a significant global
impact on individuals. According to reports, PD affects an estimated 10 million people
worldwide (0.3% of the total population), with those over 60 making up 1% of those affected.
The most common neurodegenerative condition is Alzheimer's disease. Although the signs are
first mild, they worsen over time. Among dementias, Alzheimer's disease is one of the most
common. There is no cure for this disease, making it difficult to treat. The sickness is identified,
but only at an advanced stage. Therefore, if the condition is identified earlier, its course or
symptoms may be slowed.

# AIM:
- We are proposing a system which can predict the Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease based
on the test records obtained from the clinic
The importance of this project that many people across the globe suffer with either of these
diseases and getting to know about these diseases in the earlier stages might help them recover
with some treatment. So, building a model which can accurately predict the condition of the
patient is very crucial.

# CONCLUSION:
- The results of this project will be telling us if the person has Parkinson’s disease or not and for
the Alzheimer’s case it will tell what kind of class that like Non-Demented, Very Mild
Demented, Mild Demented, Moderately Demented.
When it comes to the comparison of results with the existing method, we provided a better
accuracy model for predicting the Parkinson’s disease using different machine learning
classifiers. We also used CNN for classifying the images for Alzheimer’s which works better
than SVM and Decision tree classifiers.
